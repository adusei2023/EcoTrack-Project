            <h2>Understanding Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate. It involves variations in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other environmental factors. The primary driver of recent climate change is human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change has far-reaching effects on natural and human systems, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rising Temperatures:</strong> Global temperatures have increased, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves. Learn more at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GISS/temperature_anomaly/index.html" target="_blank">NASA's Global Temperature Data</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels:</strong> The polar ice caps and glaciers are melting, contributing to sea-level rise, which threatens coastal communities. Check out <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/sea-level-rise" target="_blank">NOAA's Sea Level Rise Information</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Changes in Weather Patterns:</strong> Climate change disrupts weather patterns, causing extreme events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall. See more at <a href="https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/agm/ebfs/ebfs_home.html" target="_blank">World Meteorological Organization</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Ecosystems:</strong> Shifts in temperature and precipitation affect ecosystems and biodiversity, leading to habitat loss and species extinction. Explore <a href="https://www.cbd.int/" target="_blank">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> for details.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Health Risks:</strong> Increased temperatures and changing weather patterns can exacerbate health issues, including heat-related illnesses and the spread of infectious diseases.

            <h2>Mitigation and Adaptation</h2>
            <p>Addressing climate change requires a comprehensive approach that includes mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (preparing for and managing the effects). Mitigation efforts include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and protecting natural carbon sinks like forests. Adaptation strategies involve building resilient infrastructure, improving water management, and supporting communities most vulnerable to climate impacts.</p>
            <p>Learn more about mitigation strategies at <a href="https://www.iea.org/topics/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage" target="_blank">International Energy Agency - Carbon Capture</a> and adaptation at <a href="https://www.adaptation-undp.org/" target="_blank">UNDP Climate Change Adaptation</a>.</p>
